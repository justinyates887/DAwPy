We can use Python to inpect, cleanse, and transform data that we can then model to discover useful information.

Tools to learn:

- Auto-managed
    Qlik
    tableau
    looker
    zoho
    excel

- Languages
    Python
    R
    julia

Knowing scriptingn languages allows for free, customized, and open-sourced tools you can utilize.

Python has pwerful libraries avaiable for use, making it a top contender for DA.

R is good for more advanced statistical methods and performance.

Steps to DA:

1) Extraction
2) Cleaning
3) Wrangling
4) Analysis
5) Action

Libraries:

pandas
matplotlib
numpy
seaborn
statsmodels
scipy
scikit-learn
